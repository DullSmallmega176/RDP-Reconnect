# RDP-Reconnect
A simple macro where it keeps your RDP sessions open, based off Remote Desktop Plus.

# General Setup
1. have the shortcuts in the same location as the macro file itself. they are supposed to be .lnk files also.
2. Run script as administrator. Even tho it may seem scary, it's because it allows for mstsc.exe to actually close.
3. you'll need to configure based off your setup, this means the local user's username. window title based off the shortcut. and also the shortcut itself.
